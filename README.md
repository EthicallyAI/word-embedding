### In a Nutshell

- In this **one and a half hours workshop**, we will explore bias
  in a word embedding - a **widespread building block** of many machine learning models
  that work with natural languages.
- Word embeddings have an easy-to-explain representation
  that allows an **intuitive understanding** of this building block
  and its **potential biases**.
- Through the exploration, we will raise practical, methodological
  and philosophical questions about the **ethics of AI**.
- The workshop is **designed for a diverse audience**:
  from without any background in machine learning or programming
  to data science practitioners - **no technical background is required!**
-  The workshop is **hands-on** and **interactive**,
   and will use the same tools that data scientists are using.
